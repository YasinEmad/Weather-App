### Project Structure and Logic Overview

#### Project Structure
1. **App.js**: The main file where the app's functionality is defined. It handles the fetching of weather data, rendering of components, and manages the state for the weather data, loading, errors, and unit selection.
2. **component/Cardcontainer.js**: This file contains the `WeatherCard` component, responsible for displaying weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions in a card layout. It also includes a button to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
3. **component/SearchBar.js**: A search bar component that allows users to input a city name. It has input validation and triggers a search when the user submits a valid city.
4. **App.css**: The CSS file used for styling the components. It is used to define the app's overall appearance and layout.
5. **`package.json`**: Contains project dependencies, scripts, and metadata like the project name and version.

#### Logic
1. **State Management**:
   - `weatherData`: Stores weather details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
   - `loading`: A boolean flag that determines whether data is being fetched or not.
   - `error`: Holds error messages if the API request fails.
   - `unit`: Stores the unit of temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
  
2. **Fetching Weather Data**:
   - On initial load or when a city is searched, `fetchWeatherData` is called to get the weather information from the OpenWeather API.
   - `axios` is used to make HTTP requests, and data is processed to extract useful information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
   - The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch data when the component first mounts.

3. **Unit Toggle**:
   - The `toggleUnit` function switches between Celsius (`C`) and Fahrenheit (`F`). When the button is clicked, it toggles the unit for temperature display.

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Users can search for weather information by entering a city name into the `SearchBar`. Upon submission, the `handleSearch` function fetches weather data for the entered city.
   - If the input is empty, an error message is shown.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors during data fetching are caught and displayed. The `handleRetry` function allows the user to retry fetching data after an error.

6. **WeatherCard**:
   - This component displays the weather information, including the temperature, weather condition, wind speed, humidity, and more.
   - It provides an animated weather icon and offers a button to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

#### Tools and Libraries Used
1. **React.js**: The JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing state and side effects.
2. **Material UI**: A popular React UI library used for styling the components. It provides pre-built components such as `Card`, `Button`, `TextField`, and `Alert`.
3. **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data.
4. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the components with responsive design. It helps create a clean and modern design without writing custom CSS for every element.
5. **OpenWeather API**: Provides weather data that the app fetches based on the city name input.

### Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to use the app.

### Usage
- Enter a city name in the search bar to get the weather data for that location.
- Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit using the "Switch to Celsius/Fahrenheit" button.
- If an error occurs while fetching data, click the "Retry" button to attempt fetching again.

This setup provides a clean, interactive weather application with features such as error handling, unit toggling, and real-time data fetching.
